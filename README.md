This is suited for someone who needs extra keyboards as macro-keys.
I've been through some other software-only options like Intercept, HiDMacros and such, but the only one that suits me better is this one, as it is mostly stable tbh.

I may create a GUI Interface for easy utilization of scripting and key changing, as I could not find any easy-to-do setup for that.

If you want to run that, you will need:
- AutoHotkey.
- LuaMacros.
- Python (in a near future, I'm probably going to integrate it as I learn more about it).

That's inspired on Taran's 2nd Keyboard. I did learn a lot from his and I'll be trying to improve it.
